2. Open Termial
3. Navigate to the downloaded folder
4. Run the following script
5. That's it :) 🍻

## Usage
 
After installing you can access the templates from File -> New -> File. 

Scroll to the bottom and you can see a section named Mold2.

## Notice
The file templates generated for VIPER and CleanArchitecture require the use of the [Swinject/SwinjectStoryboard](https://github.com/Swinject/SwinjectStoryboard) as a DI container.

For more information about Swinject/SwinjectStoryboard, please check the documentation or the sample code to use.
